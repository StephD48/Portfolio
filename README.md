# Portfolio
This is a live website I created as my portfolio that links to my GitHub, LinkedIn account and examples of some of the projects I completed during my time a The Tech Academy. I utilized CSS and JavaScript for the styling and it contains a navbar, links, photo and video overlays, contact form and more.
